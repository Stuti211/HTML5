      <p>They're the few people who accept silence over conversation.
        A relationship like this denies silly promises and persuasion.
        You don't feel the need to second guess thoughts or measure words.
        <mark>Their love comes in wholes, not halves, not thirds.</mark>  
        They're the ones that guide you through when fate takes a turn.
        Fights, small and large, end in forgiveness, never a burn.
        You forget about first impressions and the feelings they brought.
        <mark>  You're grateful for who they are and you forgive 'em for what they're not.</mark>
        </p>
